        <h2>Why Compost?</h2>
        <p>
            Composting is a sustainable way of recycling organic waste, such as food scraps, yard trimmings, and other biodegradable materials. By composting, we reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, where it would decompose anaerobically and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Instead, composting turns these organic materials into nutrient-rich soil that can benefit gardens and landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to reducing landfill waste, composting plays a vital role in improving soil health. It enhances soil structure, increases water retention, and provides essential nutrients for plant growth. For gardeners and farmers alike, composting is a natural, cost-effective alternative to chemical fertilizers that helps promote a healthier ecosystem.
        </p>

    <!-- How to Compost Section -->
    <section id="how-to-compost">
        <h2>How to Compost</h2>
        <p>
            Composting is simple, but it does require a balance of green and brown materials. Green materials, such as fruit and vegetable scraps, grass clippings, and coffee grounds, provide nitrogen. Brown materials, such as dried leaves, straw, and cardboard, provide carbon. The key is to maintain a ratio of roughly 2 parts brown to 1 part green.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start composting, find a dry, shaded spot in your yard and set up a compost bin or pile. Begin by layering the materials—alternating between green and brown items. Make sure to turn the compost regularly to allow for airflow, which helps speed up the decomposition process. Over time, the organic matter will break down, and you'll be left with rich, dark compost that can be used to enrich your garden soil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some common composting mistakes to avoid include composting meat, dairy, and oily foods, as they can attract pests. It's also important to avoid using diseased plants or plants treated with pesticides in your compost pile, as these can introduce harmful substances into the compost.
        </p>

    <!-- Benefits of Composting Section -->
    <section id="composting-benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Composting</h2>
        <p>
            Composting provides numerous environmental, economic, and social benefits. From an environmental perspective, composting reduces the volume of waste sent to landfills and helps lower greenhouse gas emissions. By converting waste into compost, we can recycle valuable organic matter back into the soil, thus reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Composting also helps conserve water. The organic matter in compost retains moisture, improving soil’s ability to hold water and reducing the need for frequent watering. This is especially beneficial in drought-prone areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Economically, composting can save money for individuals, households, and municipalities by reducing waste disposal costs. Additionally, gardeners can reduce the need to purchase commercial fertilizers and soil amendments, relying instead on their homemade compost.
        </p>

    <!-- Interesting Composting Facts Section -->
    <section id="composting-facts">
        <h2>Interesting Facts about Composting</h2>
        <p>
            Did you know that composting can reduce your carbon footprint by diverting organic waste from landfills, where it would produce methane? Composting helps lower greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to the fight against climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
            On average, a typical household can produce enough compost to enrich their garden for an entire year. This means that by composting, you are effectively recycling your food scraps and yard waste into valuable resources.
        </p>

    <!-- Composting Myths Section -->
    <section id="composting-myths">
        <h2>Composting Myths</h2>
        <p>
            Despite its many benefits, there are still several myths surrounding composting. One common myth is that composting is difficult and time-consuming. In reality, with a few simple steps, anyone can start composting. All you need is a compost bin or pile, a good balance of materials, and some patience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another myth is that composting is smelly. When done correctly, composting should not produce foul odors. If your compost smells, it may be a sign that it is too wet or contains too many green materials. To fix this, simply add more brown materials to the pile and turn it regularly to ensure proper aeration.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Among the top 20 countries in e-waste recycling, China leads the charge, processing over 3 million tonnes (MT) of e-waste annually. The United States follows closely, contributing around 2.9 MT, with both countries demonstrating significant improvements in electronic waste management practices over the past decade. 

    India, Brazil, and South Africa have seen consistent growth in their e-waste recycling efforts, with India making notable strides in both collection and recycling due to growing awareness and infrastructure improvements. Brazil, with its increasing population and electronics consumption, has ramped up its efforts to manage the mounting e-waste crisis.

    European countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and France have been at the forefront of responsible e-waste recycling, with Germany consistently processing over 1 million tonnes annually, and the UK showing robust growth as well. France has made substantial progress, focusing on efficient recycling systems and public awareness campaigns.

    Countries like Japan and South Korea have maintained stable e-waste recycling rates, aided by strong government policies, advanced technological infrastructure, and active citizen participation. These nations show a strong commitment to sustainability through recycling and proper e-waste disposal.

    On the other hand, smaller nations like Saudi Arabia, Argentina, and Mexico, though still processing lower quantities of e-waste, are making steady improvements through partnerships with international organizations and increased local recycling programs.</p>
